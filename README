If when trying to load a Pokemon's individual profile you find that you must wait for longer than 30 seconds, try either going back
to the Pokemon List and reselecting the Pokemon, or alternatively, restart the app (Sometimes the Volley Request just takes too long and
ignores the time-out and retries).

Best to use this on a phone/emulator with a decently sized screen!
